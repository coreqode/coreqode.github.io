Other than wandering around exploring various research problems, I love diving into books. If youâ€™re curious about what Iâ€™m reading, letâ€™s connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14982568-chandradeep-pokhariya) â€“ itâ€™s my go-to these days!

Born and raised in the Himalayas, my love for mountains and natural beauty runs deep. Iâ€™m always up for a hikeâ€”and Iâ€™m even game for a friendly race to the mountain top! My best trek so far has been the exhilarating [Hampta Pass Trek](https://indiahikes.com/hampta-pass). You can find some of my captured moments on [Lens ðŸ“·](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZY3gFY7EcSK2fAHRA)

Back in my undergraduate days, I was all about music. 
Whether I was playing [fingerstyle  guitar ðŸŽ¸](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uKAQGzjoXHCNwsdR9) or dabbling with soulful melodies of the Indian bamboo flute, music always found a way into my life. 
There was even a time when I dreamed of becoming the next *Alan Walker* or *Martin Garrix*, though life took me down a different path. 
You can listen to a selection of my tracksâ€”arranged from best to least refined in [Soundcloud ðŸŽµ](https://soundcloud.com/chandradeep-pokhariya-681934?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) (Please note, my mixing and mastering equipment was a bit modest back then!). 
One song that Iâ€™m especially proud of was removed due to copyright issues, but I still wanted to share a snippet:
