<h4 style="text-align:center"> Books & Mountains </h4>
Other than wandering around exploring various research problems, I love diving into books. 
I typically like reading non-fiction, especially books about science and tech which can complement my research, but lately, I've found myself increasingly drawn to fiction (mostly mystery, thirller and sci-fi fantasy). If youâ€™re curious about what Iâ€™m reading, letâ€™s connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14982568-chandradeep-pokhariya) â€“ itâ€™s my go-to these days!

Born and raised in the Himalayas, my love for mountains and natural beauty runs deep. Iâ€™m always up for a hikeâ€”and Iâ€™m even game for a friendly race to the mountain top! My best trek so far has been the exhilarating [Hampta Pass Trek](https://indiahikes.com/hampta-pass). You can find some of my captured moments on [Lens ðŸ“·](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZY3gFY7EcSK2fAHRA)

<h4 style="text-align:center"> Music </h4>

Back in my undergraduate days, I was all about music. 
Whether I was playing [fingerstyle  guitar ðŸŽ¸](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uKAQGzjoXHCNwsdR9) or dabbling with soulful melodies of the Indian bamboo flute, music always found a way into my life. 
There was even a time when I dreamed of becoming the next *Alan Walker* or *Martin Garrix*, although life took me down a different path. 

You can listen to a selection of my tracks on [Soundcloud ðŸŽµ](https://soundcloud.com/chandradeep-pokhariya-681934?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) (please note, my mixing and mastering equipment was a bit modest back then!). 
Here are some of the completed songs I produced, listed from best to worst.
