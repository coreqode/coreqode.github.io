#### ➤ Differentiable Simulation of adaptive-anisotropic remeshing


#### ➤ Simulating Homogenized Yarn-Level Cloth Using Generalized Position-Based Dynamics
The position-based dynamics (PBD) algorithm is a popular and versatile technique for real-time simulation of deformable
bodies, but is only applicable to forces that can be expressed as linearly compliant constraints. In this work, we explore a
generalization of PBD that is applicable to arbitrary nonlinear force models. We do this through a force-centric reformulation
of implicit time integration, to which applying Gauss-Seidel iterations naturally leads to a PBD-type algorithm. We further show
how the basic algorithm can be extended to enable robust handling of inverted elements, and exploit rigid invariance to reduce
the computational cost. As we demonstrate, our method allows interactive simulation of various material models that cannot
be represented by existing variations of position-based dynamics, such as neo-Hookean elasticity with an inversion barrier, and
homogenized yarn-level cloth
