I am currently a Senior Project Scientist under the guidance of [Dr. Rahul Narain](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/) at IIT Delhi, focusing on Differentiable Cloth Simulation.
I previously earned my M.S. (Research) degree at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in), where I was advised by [Dr Avinash Sharma](https://3dcomputervision.github.io/about/) at CVIT and [Dr Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) at [Brown IVL](https://ivl.cs.brown.edu). 

As part of my MS, I have explored a broad spectrum of research topics, including neural fields, hand-object grasp capture, textured cloth and human body reconstruction, neural surface parameterization. 
Through these varied explorations, I have developed a deep interest for <em>computational geometry, implicit surfaces,</em> and <em>physics-based simulations</em>.

In my leisure time I like to play [fingerstyle guitar](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uKAQGzjoXHCNwsdR9) and Indian bamboo flute. 
I also love being in [nature](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZY3gFY7EcSK2fAHRA) and have recently taken up boxing as a new hobby.
