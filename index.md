I am currently a Senior Research Fellow at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Rahul Narain](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/). 
My primarily research focuses on *generalized position-based-dynamics* and *differentiable simulation for adpative in-step re-meshing*.

I previously obtained my MSR degree from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in), where I was advised by [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://3dcomputervision.github.io/about/) at CVIT and [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) at Brown IVL. 
My master's work covered a range of problems at the intersection of 3D vision and computer graphics. 
I also spent five beautiful months as a visiting research fellow at Brown University.

Looking ahead, I am interested in physics-based simulation of all kind of natural phenomena, and exploring different geometric representations—such as distance fields and probability fields—to drive these simulations. 
Having grown up in the Himalayas and experienced natural calamities firsthand, I am also keen to explore extreme mechanics and in studying how materials and structures behave under severe conditions. 
Building on this, I am also excited about the computational design and fabrication of metamaterials/microstructures that remain robust in harsh environments.

If you’re interested in discussing these ideas further or exploring related research directions—and you have an open PhD position for Fall 2025—please feel free to get in touch. **I am currently seeking PhD opportunities for the upcoming admissions cycle.**
