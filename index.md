Hi! I am a MS graduate from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in), where I was advised by [Dr Avinash Sharma](https://3dcomputervision.github.io/about/) at CVIT and [Dr Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) at Brown IVL. 
During my master's, I also spent five beautiful months as a visiting research fellow at Brown University.

I am currently a Sr. Project Scientist at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), advised by [Dr. Rahul Narain](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/) where I am working on *generalized position-based-dynamics* and *differentiable simulation*.

My current research interests revolves around physical simulation and geometry processing. Specifically, I am interested in using inverse simulation to design and fabricate meta-materials and structures with desired properties. Having grown up in the Himalayas and experienced natural calamities firsthand, I am also keen to explore [extreme mechanics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/extreme-mechanics-letters), focusing on the behavior of materials and structures under severe conditions. 
Additionally, I am also interested in quantifying uncertainty and error in simulated physics when compared to real-world outcomes.

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing [fingerstyle guitar](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uKAQGzjoXHCNwsdR9) and the Indian bamboo flute. 
I also love being in [nature](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZY3gFY7EcSK2fAHRA) and have recently taken up boxing as a new hobby.
