I am a first-year PhD student in the [CRAFT](https://www.inria.fr/en/craft) team at the Inria (Université Grenoble Alpes), supervised by [Dr. Mélina Skouras](https://imagine.inrialpes.fr/people/mskouras/index.htm), [Prof. Arthur Lebée](https://navir-lab.fr/en/equipe/lebee-arthur/) and [Prof. Georges-Pierre Bonneau](https://evasion.inrialpes.fr/~Georges-Pierre.Bonneau/).
My research sits at the intersection of geometry processing, simulation and mechanics, with a focus on the computational design of origami-inspired inflatable hulls.

<!-- I am also interested in exploring different geometric representations (e.g., distance and probability fields) to drive physically-accurate simulations.  -->
<!-- Having grown up in the Himalayas and experienced natural calamities firsthand, I am also keen to explore extreme mechanics and in studying how materials and structures behave under severe conditions. -->

Previously I was a Senior Research Fellow at IIT Delhi with [Prof. Rahul Narain](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/), and I hold an MSR from IIIT Hyderabad (advised by [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) at CVIT and [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://srinathsridhar.com/) at Brown IVL). I also spent five months as a visiting research fellow at Brown University.
